      <strong>LUDA PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 4, 2024<br/>
      <br/>
      This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Luda Studios, Inc. (“<strong>Luda</strong>,”
      “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, processes, and shares your
      personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>1. SCOPE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br/>
      <br/>
      This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us through the development of any of our Luda
      projects, such as Mels, Hide & Seek, and Neo Fairies, as well as our website or other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy
      Policy easier to read, our projects and the development of our projects, as well as our website and other online or
      offline offerings, will be called the “Projects.”<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>An Important Note regarding AI Technologies:</strong> If you participate in our Projects which utilize large
      language models (“<strong>LLM</strong>”) or other generative AI (“<strong>GenAI</strong>”) systems, we may use 
      information you provide us, such as the information you provide us through certain text-prompts or in-game 
      interactions, to train or improve such models and systems and any features powered by such models and systems.<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>An Important Note regarding Blockchain Technologies:</strong> If you participate in our Projects relating to
      the creation and management of a decentralized autonomous organization (“<strong>DAO</strong>”) or non-fungible tokens
      (“<strong>NFT</strong>”), smart contracts will be employed that necessarily collect information, such as your digital
      wallet address (which some legal jurisdictions may consider personal information), and that information will be stored
      on a public blockchain that we do not control. A smart contract is computer code that automatically processes events
      when certain conditions are met; for example, when a proposal is presented to a member’s DAO and after all needed
      votes are made by respective DAO member, the smart contract will automatically execute the proposed action. In these
      situations, your personal information will be stored on that blockchain through the execution of a smart contract and
      may not be able to be modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of the blockchain.<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy.</strong> We may revise this
      Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we
      will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the
      updated Privacy Policy if you continue to use our Projects after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.<br/>
      <br/>
