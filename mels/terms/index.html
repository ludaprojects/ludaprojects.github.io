      <strong>MELS TERMS OF SERVICE</strong><br/><br/>
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 22, 2024<br/><br/>
      
      Please read these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) and our 
      <a href="https://ludaprojects.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> 
      (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) carefully because they govern your use of the website 
      (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and corresponding web application (“<strong>App</strong>”) 
      located at <a href="https://mels.ai">https://mels.ai</a> made available by Luda Studios Inc. 
      (“<strong>Luda</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”). 
      To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and App are collectively called the “<strong>Interface</strong>.”<br/><br/>
      
      Users can use the Interface to access artificial intelligence platforms, tools and infrastructure 
      for training and inference (“<strong>AI Platform</strong>”) to create, watch and share Mels 
      and connect with other users.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>NOTICE ON PROHIBITED USE – RESTRICTED PERSONS:</strong> THE INTERFACE AND ANY RELATED SERVICES 
      ARE NOT OFFERED TO AND MAY NOT BE USED BY PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO (A) RESIDE IN, ARE CITIZENS OF, 
      ARE LOCATED IN, ARE INCORPORATED IN, OR HAVE A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY RESTRICTED TERRITORY, AS 
      DEFINED BELOW; OR (B) LISTED ON THE OFAC SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS, BLOCKED PERSONS LIST, OR 
      ANY OTHER CONSOLIDATED PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST AS DETERMINED BY ANY APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY 
      (EACH SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY, A “<strong><i>RESTRICTED PERSON</i></strong>”).<br/><br/>
      
      WE DO NOT MAKE EXCEPTIONS. THEREFORE, IF YOU ARE A RESTRICTED PERSON, YOU ARE NOT 
      PERMITTED TO, AND DO NOT ATTEMPT TO, USE THE INTERFACE OR ANY RELATED SERVICES. 
      USE OF A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (“<strong>VPN</strong>”) OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR MEANS 
      INTENDED TO CIRCUMVENT THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IS PROHIBITED.<br/><br/>
      
      WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE 
      ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND LUDA THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER 
      THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 19 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR 
      DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE 
      APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 19 
      WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 18 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>1. Agreement to Terms.</strong> By using our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound 
      by these Terms, then you must not use the Interface or access the Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws of some 
      jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of this agreement, such as indemnification, the exclusion of 
      certain warranties or the limitation of liability. In such a case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent 
      permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing 
      in these terms will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Interface under such applicable law.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>2. Privacy Policy.</strong> Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Interface, for information 
      on how we collect, use and share your information.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>3. Changes to these Terms or the Interface.</strong> We may update the Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. If we do, 
      we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site or App and/or may also send other communications. It’s important 
      that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we 
      have posted updated Terms, it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, 
      you may not use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any 
      part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>4. Who May Use the Interface?</strong><br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(a) Age.</strong> You may use the Interface only if you are at least 13 years of age (or such other minimum age at which you can provide 
      consent to data processing under the laws of your territory), and not otherwise barred from using the Interface under applicable law.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(b) Restricted Territory.</strong> In order to protect the integrity of the Interface, we reserve the right, at any time, in our sole 
      discretion, to block access to the Interface from certain IP addresses and unique device identifiers. For the purposes of the 
      Terms, “<strong><i>Restricted Territory</i></strong>” means any state, country, or other jurisdiction that is designated by the U.S. Secretary of State 
      as a country supporting international terrorism, or to which U.S. nationals cannot lawfully engage in transactions as designated 
      by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“<strong>OFAC</strong>”), including Cuba, Iran, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, 
      Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>5. Feedback.</strong> We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements to the Interface (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”). 
      If you choose to submit Feedback, you agree that we are free to use it without any restriction or compensation to you.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>6. Fees.</strong> Luda may require payment of fees associated with some operations, including training and inference, that occur on the AI 
      Platform through the Interface (“<strong>AI Platform Fees</strong>”). You agree to pay all applicable AI Platform Fees associated with the Interface.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>7. About the Interface.</strong><br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(a) Regulatory and Compliance Suspensions or Terminations.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to the Interface at any time 
      in connection with any transaction as required by applicable law, any governmental authority, or if we in our sole and 
      reasonable discretion determine you are violating these Terms or the terms of any third-party service provider. Such suspension 
      or termination shall not be constituted a breach of these Terms by Luda. In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, 
      anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose reasonable limitations and controls on the ability of you or 
      any beneficiary to utilize the Interface. Such limitations may include where good cause exists, rejecting transaction requests, 
      freezing funds, or otherwise restricting you from using the Interface.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>8. Your Content.</strong><br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(a) Posting Content.</strong> Our Interface may allow you to store or share content such as text (in posts or communications with others), 
      files, documents, graphics, images, music, software, audio and video. Anything (other than Feedback) that you post or otherwise 
      make available through the Interface is referred to as “User Content”. Luda does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content 
      and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to your User Content.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(b) Permissions to Your User Content.</strong> By making any User Content available through the Interface you hereby grant to Luda a 
      non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create 
      derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection with operating 
      and providing the Interface.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(c) Your Responsibility for User Content.</strong> You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that 
      you have (and will have) all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You 
      represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through 
      the Interface, nor any use of your User Content by Luda on or through the Interface will infringe, misappropriate or violate a 
      third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(d) Removal of User Content.</strong> You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. You should know that in certain instances, 
      some of your User Content (such as posts or comments you make) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue 
      to exist on the Interface. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the 
      failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(e) Luda’s Intellectual Property.</strong> We may make available through the Interface content that is subject to intellectual property rights. 
      We retain all rights to that content.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>9. Rights and Terms for the App.</strong><br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(a) App License.</strong> If you comply with these Terms, Luda grants to you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable license, with no right 
      to sublicense, to download and install the App on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, and/or other devices 
      and to run the App solely for your own personal non-commercial purposes. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you may not: 
      (i) copy, modify or create derivative works based on the App; (ii) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend or rent the App to 
      any third party; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App (unless applicable law permits, despite this limitation); 
      or (iv) make the functionality of the App available to multiple users through any means.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(b) Additional Information: Apple App Store.</strong> This Section 9(b) applies to any App that you acquire from the Apple App Store or use on an 
      iOS device. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event of any failure 
      of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the App purchase price to you (if applicable) 
      and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App.

      but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; 
      and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement 
      and discharge of any third-party claim that your possession and use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights. Apple

      that (i) you are not located in a Restricted Territory; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

      <strong>14. Warranty Disclaimers.</strong> THE INTERFACE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE INTERFACE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS

      <strong>15. Indemnity.</strong> You will indemnify and hold Luda and its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Interface or (b) your violation of these Terms.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>16. Limitation of Liability.</strong><br/><br/>
      
      (a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER LUDA NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE INTERFACE AND CORRESPONDING SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE INTERFACE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT LUDA OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<br/><br/>
      
      (b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL LUDA’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE INTERFACE EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO LUDA FOR USE OF THE INTERFACE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO LUDA, AS APPLICABLE. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN LUDA AND YOU.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>17. Tax Obligations.</strong> You understand that you may be subject to certain tax obligations as a result of using our Interface. You represent and agree (a) that you are not relying on Luda, or any agents, representatives, members, or advisors of Luda for any tax advice, (b) that you are responsible for consulting with a tax adviser that you deem advisable in connection with our Interface, and (c) that you will fulfill any tax obligations which you are subject to as a result of using our Interface.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>18. Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 19 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Luda are not required to arbitrate will be the courts located in Delaware, and you and Luda each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>19. Dispute Resolution.</strong><br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</strong> We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Luda agree that the laws of Delaware govern the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Luda are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(b) Exceptions.</strong> As limited exceptions to Section 19(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules are available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">https://www.jamsadr.com</a>. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules. JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">https://www.jamsadr.com</a>. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location, but will be conducted remotely to the extent permitted by the JAMS Rules. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(d) Arbitration Costs.</strong> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</strong> Except as provided in Section 19(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(f) Class Action Waiver.</strong> YOU AND LUDA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(g) Severability.</strong> With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 19(f) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>20. General Terms.</strong><br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(a) Reservation of Rights.</strong> Luda and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Interface, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Interface is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Interface.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(b) Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Luda and you regarding the Interface, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Luda and you regarding the Interface. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Luda’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Luda may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(c) Notices.</strong> Any notices or other communications provided by Luda under these Terms will be given via email. The date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>(d) Waiver of Rights.</strong> Luda’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Luda. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>21. Contact Information.</strong> If you have any questions about these Terms or the Interface, please contact Luda at <a href="mailto:legal@ludaprojects.com">legal@ludaprojects.com</a>.<br/><br/>
